# Ten-Pin-Bowling

- Developed application to enter playername
- Playername textbox will be hidden once two player details are entered
- textboxes will be displayed with players turn button to add frame and rolls and count of pins.
- on adding players, post web api is triggered
- on updating the frame and rolls , put web api is triggered and update the score board
- Used Asp.net Core web api to develop application
- Used Inmemory database to save the game on each roll and frame for each player
